FitzGibbons74/FitzGibbons74 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its nearly empty, contains this `README.md' file, and is a representation of what I'd like to be doing if I could focus without distraction. Have an uncanny ability to piece code together and make it do what I want, work without understanding the language. Current plan: Developing an app to contain PBI Displays w/WebView2; PARCview; MES; in addition to a few drums and clarinets.
